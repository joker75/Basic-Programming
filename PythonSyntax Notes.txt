# SYNTAX NOTES
# x = random.randint (a,b) means a <= x <= b
# Postfix/prefix increment and decrements do not exist => use x+=1 or x-=1
# !found does not work => use found == False 
# The input must be received as an integer, not a string, if you want to evaluate it
# 	for x in range(0, 10):
		print ("We're on time",x)
